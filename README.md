# A(kim's) D(irectory) O(rganizer)
ado is a nice little script written in python to organize a directory of
your choice into 3d, audio, code, data, documents, images, markup, and video files.
It checks to see if that directory has the folder necessary to store and if not
creates it for you.

## Installation
Simply clone the repository and then add it to path
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akim1572/ado.git
```

## Usage
Run this command in the directory you wish for it to organize
```bash
python ado.py
```

## Contributing
Feel free to add different file extensions if you feel there is one you feel
is missing but make sure to fork the repository or make a new branch if you 
wish it to remain in the original github. :)
